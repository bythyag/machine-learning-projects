## ev battery health analysis

machine learning experiemnts to understand ev batteries better

### what's this?
exps on different ways to predict how ev batteries age and degrade.

### folders and stuff
```
.
├── model_parms/      # where trained models live
├── sample_data/      # test and training data
└── scripts/          # notebooks and code
```

### what i'm doing here
- trying out time series analysis (arima)
- exploration neural networks (lstm)
- looking at battery data such as how charged it is, temperature, voltage, current and age

### results
- graphs and predictions are in `/sample_data/lstm_output/`
- notebooks are in `/scripts/` if you want to try them

### why i'm doing this
- learning about battery life patterns
- getting better at time series analysis
- trying different ml approaches
- understanding how to predict maintenance needs
