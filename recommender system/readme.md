### project notes

the recommender system ipynb has two sections. 
- first section is board game recommender based on cosine similarity on tf-idf and standard scalar matrix. 
- the second section is using surprise library to run SVD and explore more on the idea. 

key insights:
- data cleaning is the moat
- it relies heavily on correlation ideas
- there are different ways to do it and particulary depend upon the performance of the algorithm (can be explored more on this idea more deeply)
- svd helps break complex matrix into lower dimension latent space and give meanings
