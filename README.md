## machine learning projects

this repo contains various machine learning projects i've been working on to get a better understanding of key concepts and algorithms using real-world example datasets.

### data cleaning
* [airplane-passanger.ipynb](data cleaning/airplane-passanger.ipynb): a notebook where i cleaned up airplane passenger data
* [movie-review.ipynb](data cleaning/movie-review.ipynb): went through the process of cleaning and prepping movie review text data

### ml projects
* [fraud_detection_in_transactions.ipynb](ml projects/fraud_detection_in_transactions.ipynb): a system that can spot fraudulent transactions
* [productivity_score_prediction.ipynb](ml projects/productivity_score_prediction.ipynb): created a model that predicts productivity scores
* [rainfall_prediction.ipynb](ml projects/rainfall_prediction.ipynb): attempted to predict rainfall using some weather data
* [Wind_Power_Time_Series.ipynb](ml projects/Wind_Power_Time_Series.ipynb): analyzed wind power generation patterns over time

### principal component analysis
* [study-iris-flower.ipynb](principal component analysis/study-iris-flower.ipynb): played around with pca on the classic iris flower dataset
* [study-twenty-newsgroups.ipynb](principal component analysis/study-twenty-newsgroups.ipynb): applied pca to explore the twenty newsgroups text collection
