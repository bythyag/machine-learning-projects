# LinkedIn Post Sentiment and Topic Analysis

This project processes LinkedIn post data from JSON files, performs sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and generates statistical insights on engagement metrics.

## Linkedin Companies

For the following companies 100 posts are scraped from LinkedIn using Apify API. The code for the same is available in ```data_collect.py```.
```
6sense, Writer, Insider, Placer.ai, Bluecore, Near, Pixis, ActiveCampaign, Datorama (Salesforce), Avaus Marketing Innovations
```
The posts are extracted along with the metadata and stored in ``` linkedin_post_dataset ``` directory.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Merges company post JSON files into a single CSV.
  - Extracts and formats key fields such as `text`, `comments`, `numShares`, `numLikes`, and `numComments`.
  - Adds `postCompany` and converts timestamps for better readability.

- **Analysis:**
  - **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses `TextBlob` to calculate sentiment polarity and classify posts as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
  - **Topic Modeling:** Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topics and their top keywords.
  - **Engagement Statistics:** Computes average shares, likes, and comments grouped by sentiment.

## Folder Structure

```
Project
│   analyze_text_data.py    # Main script for analysis
│   final.csv               # Consolidated dataset (generated by script)
│   README.md               # Documentation
└───linkedin_post_dataset   # Folder containing JSON files
```

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy textblob scikit-learn nltk plotly
   ```
   
2. **Download NLTK Data:**
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

3. **Place Data Files:**
   Store your LinkedIn JSON files in the `linkedin_post_dataset` folder.

## How to Run

1. **Preprocess Data:**
   The script automatically reads all JSON files in the dataset folder, processes them, and saves the consolidated data as `final.csv`.
   
2. **Analyze Data:**
   Run the `analyze_text_data` function to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling:
   ```python
   from analyze_text_data import analyze_text_data
   
   final_df, analysis_summary = analyze_text_data('/path/to/final.csv', n_topics=3, n_words=4)
   print(final_df.head())
   print(analysis_summary)
   ```

## Key Outputs

1. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Adds sentiment score and sentiment category (Positive, Neutral, Negative) to the dataset.

2. **Topic Modeling:**
   - Identifies dominant topics for each post and their distribution.
   - Extracts top keywords for each topic.

3. **Engagement Statistics:**
   - Computes average shares, likes, and comments by sentiment:
     ```
     numShares   numLikes   numComments
     Negative    1.71       26.71       0.93
     Neutral     2.52       33.32       1.69
     Positive    3.46       43.03       1.76
     ```

## Example Results

- **Sentiment Distribution:**
  ```
  Positive: 753
  Neutral: 133
  Negative: 14
  ```

- **Topic Keywords:**
  ```
  Topic 1: ['ai', 'https', 'marketing', 'data']
  Topic 2: ['ai', 'team', 'writer', 'event']
  Topic 3: ['customer', 'customers', 'retail', 'https']
  ```

- **Engagement Statistics by Sentiment:**
  ```
  Sentiment    Shares   Likes   Comments
  Positive     3.46     43.03   1.76
  Neutral      2.52     33.32   1.69
  Negative     1.71     26.71   0.93
  ```

## Customization

- **Adjust Topics:** Change the number of topics (`n_topics`) or keywords per topic (`n_words`) in the `analyze_text_data` function.
- **Update Dataset Path:** Modify `folder_path` and `csv_path` to match your folder structure.
